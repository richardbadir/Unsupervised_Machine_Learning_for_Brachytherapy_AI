# Unsupervised_Machine_Learning_for_Brachytherapy_AI

This is my first ever project. I worked on this before taking any official programming classes, so the code might be confusing (no comments, variables without a name that could identify what they are used for, no object oriented programming, etc.)

Most/All the code in this repository will not work, because it needs CT scans files that are not allowed to be shared outside of the hospital/lab. The file paths are designed for Linux.

Used python and machine learning to create ground truths for the brachyterapy AI my supervisor was working on. My job was to identify which voxels are needles based on the CT scans using unsupervised Machine Learning. My supervisor would then use these ground truths to create his brachytherapy AI as his project for his PhD in biomedical engineering.
